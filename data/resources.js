The phrase itself had long been used, and still is, to describe when well-bred young women were introduced to society and the world of eligible bachelors. So it was that, before World War II, an elite group of gay men “came out” at drag balls modeled after the debutante balls in the nation’s biggest cities, according to historian George Chauncey’s Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World. The more personal idea of coming out to the people in one’s own life took decades to develop from that idea, though drag balls did not fade away.

        content: 'Two-Spirit is a general term that refers to the gender identity, dress, and traditional roles of an individual within their tribe or nation. Depending on which Indigenous nation they were from, historically, many Two-Spirit individuals were responsible for the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of the tribe.Many Two-Spirit individuals were healers or medicine men and women. Often, they were mediators for the tribe, matchmakers, basket weavers, counselors, knowledge keepers, story tellers and much, much more. Today, many Two-Spirit individuals are seen in a post-colonial lens and are subject to homophobia and extreme violence. Even in a cultural capacity, very few Two-Spirit individuals are able to serve their communities in the same capacity that they would have in the past. Due to the rampant homophobia in western cultures, this has affected the Indigenous population that exists within this framework as well. Currently, many Two-Spirit peoples are not involved in ceremony as they once were. If we are lucky, we are accepted by our communities. But the sad reality is that many Two-Spirit peoples are disconnected from their culture and are often not accepted by their nation or communities. This has led to an increase in homelessness, cases of missing persons and has reinforced colonial ideals in Indigenous communities. Although the term of Two-Spirit has been popularized and made more common-place, the acceptance of the lifestyle or role of Two-Spirit individuals has not. How can we move forward in a good way despite the systemic oppression we experience as Two-Spirit individuals navigating our own intersectional existences? Through education and advocacy. Our very existence, by nature, is a form of protest. We must continue to educate others as to what it means to live and exist as an intersectional, Two-Spirit being.',
