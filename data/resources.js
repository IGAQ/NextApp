Due to the rampant homophobia in western cultures, this has affected the Indigenous population that exists within this framework as well. Currently, many Two-Spirit peoples are not involved in ceremony as they once were. If we are lucky, we are accepted by our communities. But the sad reality is that many Two-Spirit peoples are disconnected from their culture and are often not accepted by their nation or communities. This has led to an increase in homelessness, cases of missing persons and has reinforced colonial ideals in Indigenous communities. Although the term of Two-Spirit has been popularized and made more common-place, the acceptance of the lifestyle or role of Two-Spirit individuals has not. How can we move forward in a good way despite the systemic oppression we experience as Two-Spirit individuals navigating our own intersectional existences? Through education and advocacy. Our very existence, by nature, is a form of protest. We must continue to educate others as to what it means to live and exist as an intersectional, Two-Spirit being.',
